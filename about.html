    <p class="intro">
        Hi, My name is Kirian Johnson. I am a junior at Kennesaw State University majoring in Interactive Design with a
        minor in Information Technology. My hobbies are riding horses, spending time with my animals, and watching
        sports. I enjoy my major because I like designing interfaces and prototypes in Figma, and I chose my minor
        because I wanted to learn more about backend development coding.

    <p class="project">
        This is my first milestone project for my IT 3203 course (Introduction to Web Development). Through this project
        I am demonstrating my capabilities in HTML and CSS. The topic of this website is URLs and based on research that
        I did for my Assignment #1 essay.
